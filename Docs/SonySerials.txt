THE SERIAL NUMBER EXPLAINED:What is this serial number you keep taking about? Well, every officially released game, demo, etc. has a file in it whose name is the disc's serial number. Many discs have printed on then as well. The very first games released for the PlayStation did not include the serial file in them. You will find a PSX.exe file instead, but they were still printed on the CDs and jewel cases. The serial number, in almost all cases followed a format of 4 letters and 5 numbers, for example: SLUS-01234. The file name on the CD had to follow the 8.3 naming standard so you would see this like so: SLUS_012.34Many of you already know that by the serial number we are able to know what region a game is from. This is done by looking at the third letter. From our previous example, U indicates a USA/Canada release. If instead of the U you find an E or a P, that means a Europe or Japan release. Simple.Now, what few of you may know is what the rest of the letters mean (I didn't know). They are not chosen at random. Every one has a meaning.This important information was dug up (no pun intended :028: ) by Cleidophoros:The 1st letter >>> Storage MediaS = Sony commercial CD-R, Sony DVD-R 5, Sony DVD-R 9.U = Universal Media Disc (Utilized by Sony PlayStation Portable aka.
