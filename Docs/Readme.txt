# Summary
Padaea is a game organizational tool, written in C++. It is meant to be a simple to use, and open source/cross platform, game organizer, similar to other such programs. The main difference is in the way games are organized. Instead of a single string containing the whole data entry, each entry has multiple fields and the final output (for example, the renaming of files) can be generated with as much control as possible. It has tools to import data from other formats, as well as the ability to generate data from a sequence of files.
